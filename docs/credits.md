# Credits & Acknowledgments

The platform is built from many different open source projects, and would not exist without all the hard work of the folks behind:

- [Django](https://djangoproject.com)
- [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org) & [ol-ext](https://viglino.github.io/ol-ext/)
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev)
- [GDAL](https://gdal.org)
- [TiTiler](https://developmentseed.org/titiler)
- [GeoNode](https://geonode.org) (though no longer part of the codebase, GeoNode was the foundation of OldInsuranceMaps.net in [its first iteration](https://github.com/mradamcox/ohmg/releases/tag/v0.0.0-lahmg)).

A special shoutout to other web georeferencing apps that have been inspirational through this development process: [MapWarper](https://mapwarper.net), [Allmaps](https://allmaps.org), [Virtuelles KartenForum](https://kartenforum.slub-dresden.de/), and [Georeferencer](https://georeferencer.com).

I'd also like to acknowledge [Historical Information Gatherers](https://historicalinfo.org) for carrying out the [massive scanning effort](http://www.historicalinfo.com/about-us/library-of-congress-digital-map-project/) that created the digital collection that OldInsuranceMaps.net is based on.
