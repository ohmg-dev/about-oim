# Project Background

The first iteration of OldInsuranceMaps.net was made publicly available as LaHMG (Louisiana Historical Map Georeferencer) in early 2022 through a four-month pilot project, focusing on maps of Louisiana. This work formed the bulk my master's thesis at Louisiana State University: ["Creating a Public Space for Georeferencing Sanborn Maps: A Louisiana Case Study"](https://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/gradschool_theses/5641/).

Since then, I have worked hard to refactor, restructure, and streamline the platform, into what is now just called OldInsuranceMaps.net (I had hoped for a better name but one has yet to come along...). I am also slowly spinning out the software into a more generic georeferencing app called [OHMG](https://ohmg.dev) (Online Historical Map Georeferencer), because a lot of characteristics of what I had to build to facilitate crowdsourcing for this particular map collection can be applied to other georeferencing work as well.
